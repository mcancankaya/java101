# Combination Calculator

The number of different groups with r elements to be formed with the elements of a set with n elements is called the r combination of n. The r combination of N is denoted as C(n,r).

## Combination Formula
```
C(n,r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)
```

## Sample Console Output
```
Eleman (n) sayısını girin : 5
Seçim (r) sayısını girin : 3
C(5,3) = 10
```
